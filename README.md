# Biophysics Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Biophysics Machine Learning** repository! This repository contains scripts and tools for generating electrostatic and topological features, as well as training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze biophysical properties using these features.

## Overview

This repository includes the following key functionalities:
- **Electrostatic Feature Generation**: A script to compute electrostatic features for biomolecules.
- **Topological Feature Generation**: A script to compute topological features.
- **CNN Model Training**: Several scripts to train CNN models using electrostatic and topological features.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:
1. A **Python 3** environment.
2. A **virtual environment** set up (if not already done).
3. Required Python packages installed (can be set up in the virtual environment).

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv /path/to/your/venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
